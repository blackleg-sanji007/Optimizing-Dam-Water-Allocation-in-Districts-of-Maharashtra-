# Optimizing-Dam-Water-Allocation-in-Districts-of-Maharashtra
The Jayakwadi Dam is an earthen dam constructed on the Godavari River near Jayakwadi
village in Paithan taluka, located in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, India. The
dam forms the Nath Sagar Reservoir, which is one of the largest multipurpose water
projects in the state. The primary objective of this project is to provide water for
irrigation in the drought-prone Marathwada region. Additionally, the reservoir supplies
water for industrial purposes and helps fulfill the domestic water needs of the surrounding
population.
The Dudhana Dam, located in Aurangabad district, is built on the Dudhana River, a
tributary of the Godavari. Though smaller in scale, it plays a crucial role in supporting
local water demands, especially for domestic and agricultural purposes.
In this analysis, we address the joint water allocation problem involving both Nath
Sagar and Dudhana reservoirs. These reservoirs cater to multiple sectors in Aurangabad
and Ahmednagar districts, including irrigation, drinking water supply, and industrial use.
Our primary goal is to develop an optimal water allocation strategy that maximizes
the economic returns from these limited water resources. Given that Aurangabad lies
within the Nath Sagar catchment and Ahmednagar is in close proximity to the Dudhana
Dam, both districts are included in the study. By considering historic data, evaporation
losses, and sector-wise revenue generation, we aim to formulate a robust allocation model
that reflects the socio-economic priorities of the region.
For our analysis we have used the Purpose Driven Study (PDS) conducted by
the Hydrology Project Division, Aurangabad Water Resources Department,
Government of Maharashtra in June 2010.
